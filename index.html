							<br>
							Hi, I’m Jasen—a passionate and multidisciplinary professional with a deep interest in engineering, 
							business, and software development. I hold an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, an MBA, 
							and I’m currently working towards a Master’s in Software Engineering. My journey has allowed me to merge 
							technical expertise with business acumen, giving me a unique perspective in tackling complex problems from 
							both a strategic and engineering-focused lens.<br>
							<br>
							I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to continuously learn, whether it’s diving into the intricacies of 
							mechanical systems or exploring the vast landscape of software development. Currently, I’m working on projects 
							that combine my varied skill set, including developing a website that connects artists, venues, and shows, helping 
							creatives and businesses thrive. <br>
							<br>
							In addition to my technical background, I enjoy designing efficient and clean user experiences, and I’m a 
							big fan of minimalist design principles. In my free time, I’m always experimenting with new ideas in both engineering 
							and technology, striving to create solutions that make an impact.
